This repository contains the work initially developed under [GC Developers Exchange](https://beta.gcdevexchange.org): exploring event sourcing and domain-driven design to re-create relational data models traditionally associated with non-reactive systems. This initial effort is in English. Once complete, translation into French for futureusers and developers.
