# Legacy-GC-Developers-Exchange
<h3> Welcome to the Technology and Business Innovation Unit (TBI) repository</h3>
<p>
This repository contains the work initially developed under GC Developers Exchange:
exploring event sourcing and domain-driven design to re-create relational data
models traditionally associated with non-reactive systems.
This initial effort is in English. Once complete, translation into French for future
users and developers.
