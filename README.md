The Technology and Business Innovation Division supports the Regulatory Operations and Regions Branch (RORB) at Health Canada by:
* Advancing the RORB mandate and priorities through leadership in projects;
* Supporting the departmental project management approach to investment plan projects via Project Management Office;
* Providing a structured and interlinked vision for IM/IT using a RORB ONE strategy.




This repository contains the work initially developed under [GC Developers Exchange](https://beta.gcdevexchange.org): exploring event sourcing and domain-driven design to re-create relational data models traditionally associated with non-reactive systems. This initial effort is in English. Once complete, translation into French for futureusers and developers.
